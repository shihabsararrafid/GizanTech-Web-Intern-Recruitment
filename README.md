[API Reference](https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb/)

### Task 1 (50pts)

1. Create a server with NodeJS/PHP to clone the above API. All the API data is located in `exercise.json` file under `files` folder.
2. You will read the `exercise.json` file and serve the requested data in json format to all the API endpoints. (You will see that there are 9 GET endpoints).
3. Create some pages to show every API response. To show array of strings, you can use lists. To show array of objects, you can use cards/tables. You are free to design this yourself.

### Task 2 (75pts)

1. Move `exercise.json` data to `Firebase/MongoDB/MySQL` and use the database instead of `exercise.json` file.
2. Create 3 pages to Add/Update/Delete an exercise. (You should upload a random image (no need to be a gif) and use that image link for 'gifUrl')

### Task 3 (125pts)

1. Implement user authentication.
2. To Add/Update/Delete and exercise, a user must be authenticated to do so.
3. On the page where you list all the exercises, create a form to filter the result based on bodyPart, equipment, and target values. You can use 3 select inputs for this.
4. Export the filtered data to Excel, PDF, and CSV format.

### Task 4 (150pts)

1. Develop the web pages located under `designs` folder.
2. You are required to make the pages as much identical as possible.
